# Performance Benchmarks

This module contains performance benchmarks for the consensus layer, along with a Grafana + VictoriaMetrics visualization stack for analyzing metrics.

## Running Benchmarks

### Single run via Gradle

```bash
./gradlew :consensus-sloth:testPerformance
```

This runs the `ConsensusLayerBenchmark` test which:
- Spins up a 4-node network in containers
- Submits a warm-up phase of 1000 empty transactions
- Submits 1000 benchmark transactions at 20 ops/s
- Measures and reports consensus latency

Metrics are written to:

```
build/container/ConsensusLayerBenchmark/benchmark/node-*/data/stats/metrics.txt
```

### Single run and start Grafana

```bash
./gradlew :consensus-sloth:benchmarkAndVisualize
```

This runs the benchmarks first, then automatically starts the Grafana visualization stack with the results.

You can also point to a custom metrics location:

```bash
./gradlew :consensus-sloth:benchmarkAndVisualize -PmetricsPath="path/to/metrics.txt"
```

To run only a specific experiment and then visualize, use `-PtestFilter` (note the `=` is required):

```bash
./gradlew :consensus-sloth:benchmarkAndVisualize -PtestFilter="*.CombinedOptimizationsExperiment"
```

### Running a single experiment

Use `--tests` to run a specific experiment (or `-PtestFilter` which also works with `benchmarkAndVisualize`):

```bash
# Run only the baseline benchmark
./gradlew :consensus-sloth:testPerformance --tests "*.ConsensusLayerBenchmark"

# Run only a specific experiment
./gradlew :consensus-sloth:testPerformance --tests "*.CombinedOptimizationsExperiment"

# Equivalent using -PtestFilter (works with both testPerformance and benchmarkAndVisualize)
./gradlew :consensus-sloth:testPerformance -PtestFilter="*.MaxOtherParentsExperiment"

# Run a single test method within an experiment
./gradlew :consensus-sloth:testPerformance --tests "*.CombinedOptimizationsExperiment.combinedAllOptimizations"
```

Available experiments:
- `ConsensusLayerBenchmark` — Baseline benchmark (defaults)
- `AntiSelfishnessExperiment` — Anti-selfishness factor variations
- `CreationAttemptRateExperiment` — Event creation attempt rate variations
- `MaxCreationRateExperiment` — Max event creation rate variations
- `MaxOtherParentsExperiment` — Max other parents variations
- `SignatureSchemeExperiment` — Signature scheme comparisons (RSA vs EC)
- `CombinedOptimizationsExperiment` — Combined best settings

### Multiple runs via shell script

The `run-benchmark.sh` script runs experiments multiple times, extracts the average latency from
each run, and saves all artifacts (logs, CSVs, metrics) to `~/benchmark-results/` with timestamped
directories:

```bash
src/testPerformance/run-benchmark.sh [experiment] [num_runs]
```

- `experiment`: Which experiment to run (default: `all`)
  - `benchmark`, `maxotherparents`, `antiselfishness`, `maxcreationrate`, `signature`, `combined`, or `all`
- `num_runs`: Number of times to run the experiment(s) (default: `1`)

Each run produces a directory like `~/benchmark-results/20260216-143022_testName_experiment_avg-42/` containing:
- `swirlds-node-*.log` and `otter-node-*.log` — node logs
- `stats/MainNetStats*.csv` — CSV statistics
- `stats/metrics-node-*.txt` — per-node metrics in Prometheus format

Examples:

```bash
# Run all experiments once
src/testPerformance/scripts/run-benchmark.sh

# Run all experiments 5 times each
src/testPerformance/scripts/run-benchmark.sh all 5

# Run only the combined experiment 3 times
src/testPerformance/scripts/run-benchmark.sh combined 3

# Run only the baseline benchmark once
src/testPerformance/scripts/run-benchmark.sh benchmark
```

### Running benchmarks on a remote server

The `deploy-benchmark.sh` script connects to a remote server via SSH, prepares the repository,
runs benchmark experiments there, and transfers the results back as a `.tar.gz` archive. It requires
key-based SSH authentication (no password prompts).

```bash
src/testPerformance/scripts/deploy-benchmark.sh <user@server> <branch> [experiment] [num_runs]
```

- `user@server`: SSH destination (e.g. `ubuntu@10.0.1.5`)
- `branch`: Git branch to checkout and benchmark
- `experiment`: Which experiment to run (default: `all`)
- `num_runs`: Number of times to run the experiment(s) (default: `1`)

Before running, the script verifies that:
1. SSH key-based authentication works for the target server
2. No Gradle processes are running on the server
3. No other interactive users are logged in

The repository is cloned on first use and reused on subsequent runs. Results are archived and
downloaded to `~/benchmark-results/remote/` with a filename that includes the server, branch,
and timestamp.

Examples:

```bash
# Run all experiments once on a remote server
src/testPerformance/scripts/deploy-benchmark.sh ubuntu@10.0.1.5 feature/my-branch

# Run the combined experiment 3 times
src/testPerformance/scripts/deploy-benchmark.sh ubuntu@10.0.1.5 develop combined 3

# Run only the baseline benchmark
src/testPerformance/scripts/deploy-benchmark.sh user@benchmark-host main benchmark
```

To inspect the downloaded results:

```bash
# List archive contents
tar -tzf ~/benchmark-results/remote/benchmark-10.0.1.5-feature-my-branch-20260220-143022.tar.gz

# Extract to a directory
tar -xzf ~/benchmark-results/remote/benchmark-10.0.1.5-feature-my-branch-20260220-143022.tar.gz -C ~/benchmark-results/
```

## Starting Grafana Independently

### With default metrics location

```bash
./gradlew :consensus-sloth:startGrafana
```

This imports metrics from the default path (`build/container/ConsensusLayerBenchmark/benchmark/node-*/data/stats/metrics.txt`).

### With a custom metrics location

```bash
./gradlew :consensus-sloth:startGrafana -PmetricsPath="/absolute/path/to/metrics.txt"
```

### Using the shell script directly

```bash
cd platform-sdk/consensus-sloth
src/testPerformance/scripts/start-grafana.sh [--keep-data] [paths...]
```

The script accepts files, directories, or glob patterns as arguments. When given a directory, it
automatically finds all `metrics*.txt` files inside it. This makes it easy to load results from
multiple benchmark runs at once — just point it at the results directories.

Examples:

```bash
# Import from a specific file
src/testPerformance/scripts/start-grafana.sh /tmp/my-run/node-0/metrics.txt

# Point to a results directory (finds all metrics*.txt files inside)
src/testPerformance/scripts/start-grafana.sh ~/benchmark-results/20260216-143022_avg-42/stats/

# Load multiple runs at once by passing several directories
src/testPerformance/scripts/start-grafana.sh \
  ~/benchmark-results/20260216-143022_avg-42/stats/ \
  ~/benchmark-results/20260216-150512_avg-38/stats/

# Use a glob to load all saved runs
src/testPerformance/scripts/start-grafana.sh ~/benchmark-results/*/stats/

# Append metrics from a new run without losing previously imported data
src/testPerformance/scripts/start-grafana.sh --keep-data ~/benchmark-results/20260216-160000_avg-40/stats/
```

## Helper scripts

To look for metrics from previous runs and choose which ones to import, use:

```bash
src/testPerformance/scripts/find-metrics.sh
```

To import metrics to an already running Grafana stack without restarting:

```bash
src/testPerformance/scripts/import-metrics.sh
```

To upload the dashboard JSON to Grafana (only needed if you want to modify the dashboard or start from a clean Grafana
without preloaded dashboards):

```bash
src/testPerformance/scripts/upload-dashboards.sh
```

## Accessing the Visualization

Once started, the stack is available at:

- **Grafana Dashboard**: http://localhost:3000/d/consensus-metrics (no login required)
- **VictoriaMetrics**: http://localhost:8428

The dashboard provides:
- A **node** variable to filter by specific nodes
- A **metric** variable to select which metric to visualize

## Stopping the Stack

```bash
src/testPerformance/scripts/stop-grafana.sh
```

This removes both containers, the data volume, and the Docker network.
