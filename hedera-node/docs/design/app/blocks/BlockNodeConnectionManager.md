## Abstract

This document describes the internal design and responsibilities of the `BlockNodeConnectionManager` class.
This component manages active connections, handling connection lifecycle, and coordinating
with individual connection instances. There should be only one active connection at a time.
The class also interacts with the `BlockBufferService` to retrieve blocks/requests and notify the buffer of acknowledged
blocks.

## Component Responsibilities

- Maintain a registry of active connection instances.
- Track the latest verified block for each connection.
- Select the most appropriate connection for streaming blocks based on priority.
- Retry failed connections with exponential backoff (configurable multiplier and max delay).
- Track retry state and health statistics per node across connection lifecycles.
- Remove or replace failed connections.
- Support lifecycle control and dynamic configuration updates.

## Component Interaction

- Maintains a bidirectional association with each connection.
- Calls `BlockBufferService` to get the blocks/requests to send and to also notify the buffer when blocks are acknowledged.
- Updates connection state and retry schedule based on feedback from connections.

## Block Node Selection

When the consensus node wants to connect to a block node to start streaming data to, potential block nodes are loaded
from `block-nodes.json`. Nodes are grouped by configured priority (lower number = higher priority), and each group is
evaluated in ascending priority order.

For each node in a priority group, a service connection is used to retrieve status (`lastAvailableBlock`). For each
reachable node, the manager derives:

- `wantedBlock = lastAvailableBlock + 1` (or `-1` if the block node reports `-1`)
- whether the node is in range for immediate streaming based on CN buffer range

Filtering and candidate classification:

- Unreachable/timed-out nodes are excluded.
- Nodes with `wantedBlock < earliestAvailableBlock` are excluded (CN no longer has those blocks).
- If CN has no buffered blocks (`latestAvailableBlock == -1`), all reachable nodes are considered immediately eligible.
- For CNs with buffered blocks:
  - **In-range candidate**: `wantedBlock <= latestAvailableBlock`
  - **Ahead candidate**: `wantedBlock > latestAvailableBlock`

Selection algorithm (cross-priority):

1. Evaluate priority groups in ascending order.
2. If a group has any **in-range** candidates, select randomly from those in-range candidates and stop.
3. If a group has only **ahead** candidates, do not select yet; track that group's lowest `wantedBlock` candidates.
4. Continue evaluating subsequent priority groups.
5. If no in-range candidates are found in any group, select from the **global lowest `wantedBlock`** across all ahead-only
   groups.
6. If multiple nodes are tied at that global lowest `wantedBlock`, select randomly among the tied nodes.

This ensures we prefer immediate streamability first, while still making forward progress by selecting the "oldest"
ahead node when every group is ahead.

If no viable node is found at all, no connection is established. The selection process is retried later while the
buffer service remains active.

## Sequence Diagrams

### Connection Establishment

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Manager as BlockNodeConnectionManager
    participant Task as BlockNodeConnectionTask
    participant Conn as BlockNodeStreamingConnection

    Manager->>Manager: Select next priority block node
    Manager->>Conn: Create connection with new gRPC client
    Manager->>Task: Schedule connection attempt with initial delay

    Note over Task: Task executes after delay

    alt connection task execution
      Task->>Task: Check if can promote based on priority
      Task->>Conn: Create request pipeline and establish gRPC stream
      Conn->>Conn: Transition to READY state

      alt promotion successful
        Task->>Conn: Promote to ACTIVE state
        Task->>Manager: Set as active connection
        Task->>Task: Close old active connection if exists
      else promotion failed (preempted)
        Task->>Task: Reschedule with exponential backoff
      end
    end
```

### Connection Error and Retry

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Conn as BlockNodeStreamingConnection
    participant Manager as BlockNodeConnectionManager

    Conn->>Conn: Transition to CLOSING state
    Conn->>Conn: Close pipeline and release resources
    Conn->>Conn: Transition to CLOSED state
    Conn->>Manager: Request reschedule with delay and block number

    alt Fixed Delay (30s)
        Note over Manager: Schedule retry with 30 second delay<br/>Select new priority node immediately
    else Exponential Backoff
        Note over Manager: Calculate jittered delay (1s, 2s, 4s, ...)<br/>Retry same node
    end

    Manager->>Manager: Schedule connection attempt
```

### Shutdown Lifecycle

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Manager as BlockNodeConnectionManager
    participant Conn as BlockNodeStreamingConnection

    alt shutdown
      Manager -> Manager: Stop configuration watcher
      Manager -> Manager: Deactivate connection manager
      Manager -> Manager: Shutdown block buffer service
      Manager -> Manager: Shutdown executor service
      Manager -> Manager: Stop worker thread
      loop over all connections
        Manager ->> Conn: Close connection
        Conn ->> Conn: Transition to CLOSING state
        Conn ->> Conn: Close pipeline
        Conn ->> Conn: Transition to CLOSED state
      end
      Manager -> Manager: Clear connection map and metadata
    end

```

## Error Handling

- Implements backoff-based retry scheduling when connections fail.
- Detects and cleans up errored or stalled connections.
- If `getLastVerifiedBlock()` or other state is unavailable, logs warnings and may skip the connection.

### Retry and Exponential Backoff Mechanism

The connection manager implements two distinct retry strategies based on the type of failure:

#### Fixed Delay Retry

Used when the consensus node should immediately connect to a different block node:
- **Scenarios**: `SUCCESS`, `ERROR`, `PERSISTENCE_FAILED`, `UNKNOWN`, `BEHIND` (without block in buffer), EndOfStream rate limit exceeded
- **Delay**: Fixed 30 seconds
- **Behavior**: Failed node is rescheduled for retry while the manager immediately selects a new priority node

#### Exponential Backoff Retry

Used when retrying the same block node after transient issues:
- **Scenarios**: `TIMEOUT`, `DUPLICATE_BLOCK`, `BAD_BLOCK_PROOF`, `INVALID_REQUEST`, `BEHIND` (with block in buffer)
- **Initial Delay**: 1 second (`INITIAL_RETRY_DELAY`)
- **Multiplier**: 2x (`RETRY_BACKOFF_MULTIPLIER`)
- **Jitter**: Applied as `delay/2 + random(0, delay/2)` to spread out retry attempts and avoid multiple nodes retrying simultaneously
- **Max Backoff**: Configurable via `maxBackoffDelay` (defaults to 10 seconds)
- **Reset**: Retry count resets if no retry occurs within `protocolExpBackoffTimeframeReset` duration
- **Behavior**: Connection retries the same node without selecting a new one

#### Forced Connection Switch Retry Delay

When another block node should be selected and forced to become active, the previous active connection
is closed and scheduled for retry after a fixed delay of 180s (`blockNode.forcedSwitchRescheduleDelay`).
This may happen when the block buffer saturation action stage is triggered and the manager force switches to a different node.

#### Retry State Management

- `RetryState` tracks retry attempts and last retry time per node configuration
- State persists across individual connection instances
- Automatic reset of retry counter after configurable idle period
- Nodes are excluded from selection only while they have an active connection in the `connections` map
