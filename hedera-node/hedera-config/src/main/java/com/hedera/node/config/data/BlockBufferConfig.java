/**
 * Configuration settings related to the block buffer.
 *
 * @param maxBlocks the maximum number of blocks that can be buffered before the buffer is considered full
 * @param workerInterval interval to perform periodic tasks related to the block buffer (e.g. pruning and persisting
 *                       buffer to disk)
 * @param actionStageThreshold the threshold (as a percentage from 0.0 to 100.0) at which proactive measures are
 *                             taken to attempt faster buffer recovery. This threshold is measured against the
 *                             current saturation level of the buffer. (For example, a value of '20.0' means
 *                             once the buffer saturated reaches 20% or higher, proactive measures will be taken
 *                             such as attempting to connect to a different block node.)
 * @param actionGracePeriod the period between buffer recovery action attempts. After an action has been performed to
 *                          attempt buffer recovery, there will be a grace period before the next recovery attempt is
 *                          triggered. That delay is this configuration property.
 * @param recoveryThreshold the threshold (as a percentage from 0.0 to 100.0) of which the buffer saturation level must
 *                          be decreased by before the buffer is considered "in recovery" and back pressure (if enabled)
 *                          can be removed. (For example, a value of '85.0' means at least 15% of the buffer capacity
 *                          must be available. Said another way: the buffer saturation must be at or below 85% before
 *                          the buffer is considered recovered.)
 * @param isBufferPersistenceEnabled true if periodic persistence to disk of the block buffer is permitted, else false
 * @param bufferDirectory the root directory that the block buffer will be persisted into, if enabled
